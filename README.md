# PROJECT: 0x1A. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
### TEAM MEMBERS: Ben Sbanotto & Matthew Allen

## TASKS:
### 0. Bubble sort - 0-bubble_sort.c, 0-O
	Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm.
	The file 0-O contains the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm.

### 1. Insertion sort - 1-insertion_sort_list.c, 1-O
	Function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm.
	The file 1-O contains the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm.

### 2. Selection sort - 2-selection_sort, 2-O
	Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm.
	The file 2-O contains the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm.

### 3. Quick sort - 3-quick_sort.c, 3-O
	Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm.
	The file 3-O contains the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm
